## About This Project
This project is built using modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui components. It features:

- A clean, responsive design to highlight Rudra's professional profile.
- An interactive chatbot assistant that answers questions about Rudra's background, skills, projects, and more.
- Careful handling of offensive or sensitive questions by the chatbot to ensure respectful and positive interactions.
- A "Let's Connect" section with contact details including email, phone, and social media links.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API for chatbot responses

## How AI Helped in This Project
This project demonstrates how AI can significantly simplify and accelerate development workflows. By integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, the chatbot provides intelligent, context-aware responses, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

Throughout the development process, I learned valuable skills including:
- How to effectively integrate AI APIs into a modern web application.
- Techniques for handling sensitive or offensive content gracefully in conversational AI.
- Best practices for building responsive and accessible React components with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Managing state and asynchronous operations in React for a smooth user experience.

AI made it easier to focus on building meaningful features while automating complex natural language understanding tasks.

### Why This Portfolio Stands Out
- **Conversational AI**: The chatbot is not just a static FAQâ€”it understands context, handles sensitive topics with care, and provides a friendly, interactive experience.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with the latest tools and best practices for performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
- **Personal Touch**: Every section, from achievements to contact, is tailored to reflect Rudra's journey and values.
- **Open for Collaboration**: Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow developer, you're welcome to connect and contribute.
